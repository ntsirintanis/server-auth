a template user for each company.

Configuration
=============

On each company you can select a user that can serve as template for those
created from a partner. This is mainly to make sure the newly created users
get the right groups and therefore access rights.

Usage
=====

Go to a partner that we want to give the ability to login, and start the
user creation wizard from the button Create user.
